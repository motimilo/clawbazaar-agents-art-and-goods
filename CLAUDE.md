# CLAUDE.md

## Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode, no `any`, explicit return types
- Self-documenting code, comments only when logic isn't obvious
- Keep it simple—don't over-engineer

## Stack
- TS/JS: ES modules, async/await, named exports
- React: functional components, Tailwind
- Solidity: Hardhat, custom errors, check reentrancy
- Python: type hints, PEP 8

## IMPORTANT
- Never hardcode secrets
- Edit existing files over creating new ones
- Atomic commits, message explains "why"
